***1. What skills do you believe you bring to game design?***
Creativity and storytelling

***2. What constraints do you feel that you have when it comes to making your own game?***
I feel like i have no running start. I have to slowly try to understand what I want in my game. That may take some time.

***3. Think about a game you have played and talk about a constraint, you think, the developers may have had when developing that game. (for example: in Super Mario Brothers they were constrained by the amount of memory available on the NES console so they reused a lot of art assets to save memory like using Mushrooms for powerups, 1ups, and enemies, chaning lugi's color so they could use the same sprite for 2 differnet players, or how the bushes and clouds are the same sprites with different collors)***
 In God of War, they wanted the game to be completely devoid of loading times. That was alittle difficult on outdated consoles so they disguised all the loading times in cutscenes and elaborate elevator scenes.

***What do you like about the RPG: Creator Kit?***
I like that is simple and easy to understand. Alot of beginner tutorials don't seem to realize that they are for beginner
s
***What do you dislike?***
Ironically, despite the fact that I respect its simplicity, I think that it is too slow paced. I think it should be a little quicker and more intuitive so that
whoever is taking it, doesn't lose interest.

***How do you feel the tutorial could be improved?***
I think that some of the different "lessons"(since I don't know what exactly to refer to them as) should be combined or atleast can be. This way it doesn't take too long to get
through as opposed to how it is now...understandable thought, since some people need some more time and need to be more in depth.**/

**What comes to mind when you think of RPGs?**
When I think of RPGs, I immediately begin thinking about Pokemon.

**What is your favorite RPG? **
Undertale is my favorite RPG. Its an amazingly created game with an amazing story and some terrifyingly cool game mechanices.

**Do you play RPGs for the gameplay or the story?**
Honestly, I'm not a big RPG fan. Its interesting but I feel its alittle outdated. I'd rather play a platformer. IF i do play an RPG, it probably has a god-tier storymode.

**Is this your first text based RPG?**
It isn't but I am blanking on the game that I had played. 

**If you have played other RPGs what did you notice that was similar to visual RPGs? If you haven't played other RPGs what other media did Zork remind you of?**
It had very clearly mapped out dialogue trails. Saying something specific would get you to the next level but if you say the wrong thing, the game disguises its ignorance in some whimsical, related fashion 

**What did you find frustrating about this game?**
The concept is very simple and it can be fun, but at some points, the required dialogue start phrase was very vaguely hinted at so you can get stuck some times. 

**Were you able to find all of the trophies?**
Nope, i am honestly, not patient enough. This is a big reason why im not a fan of RPGs but I do recognize them as a vital aspect of the different learning stages of game development...also,  i need to be more patient
Do you think the game would be as challenging if it wasn't text based?
The entire of aesthetic of the game is that its text-based. I don't think it would make sense if it wasn't text-based.

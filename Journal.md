**What comes to mind when you think of RPGs?**
When I think of RPGs, I immediately begin thinking about Pokemon.

**What is your favorite RPG? **
Undertale is my favorite RPG. Its an amazingly created game with an amazing story and some terrifyingly cool game mechanices.

**Do you play RPGs for the gameplay or the story?**
Honestly, I'm not a big RPG fan. Its interesting but I feel its alittle outdated. I'd rather play a platformer. IF i do play an RPG, it probably has a god-tier storymode.

**Is this your first text based RPG?**
It isn't but I am blanking on the game that I had played. 

**If you have played other RPGs what did you notice that was similar to visual RPGs? If you haven't played other RPGs what other media did Zork remind you of?**
It had very clearly mapped out dialogue trails. Saying something specific would get you to the next level but if you say the wrong thing, the game disguises its ignorance in some whimsical, related fashion 

**What did you find frustrating about this game?**
The concept is very simple and it can be fun, but at some points, the required dialogue start phrase was very vaguely hinted at so you can get stuck some times. 

**Were you able to find all of the trophies?**
Nope, i am honestly, not patient enough. This is a big reason why im not a fan of RPGs but I do recognize them as a vital aspect of the different learning stages of game development...also,  i need to be more patient
Do you think the game would be as challenging if it wasn't text based?
The entire of aesthetic of the game is that its text-based. I don't think it would make sense if it wasn't text-based.
